## Presentation

The 404CTF-2024 is the third edition of the 404CTF, co-organized by DGSE, Télécom SudParis, HackademINT, OVHcloud, and Viva Technology. The 2024 edition took place from April 20 to May 12, 2024, bringing together over 3000 participants around 72 challenges designed by HackademINT.

Most of the challenges have been made public by the HackademINT club along with their solutions [here](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2024).

## Context

Here is my result and the details of my participation in the 404CTF. It was a great experience even though the last week of the competition coincided with my vacation, which prevented me from tackling the new challenges added at that time.

Being not very experienced in this kind of competition, my way of solving problems is not very "write-up friendly". Many challenges were solved "with paper/pencil" and [dCode](dcode.fr), or the computer was used mostly as a calculator, so to speak.

## Personal Results

**Ranking:** 140th / 3791

**Final Score:** 5990 points

## Challenges 

All challenges have a base score of 1000 points, except for introductory challenges which have a score of 100 points.  
This score decreases based on the number of validations to rebalance the challenges according to their difficulty.  
The score of a challenge cannot drop below 200 points. Introductory challenges are not subject to this rebalancing.
